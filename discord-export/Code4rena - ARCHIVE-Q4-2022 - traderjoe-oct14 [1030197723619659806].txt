When swapping tokens, L should remain constant, while x and y should follow L = p * x + y and fees should only increase

Hey we don’t have the final report yet but will get it


[10/15/2022 06:53] rustyrabbit
Does this `The LBRouter is the main contract that user will interact with as it adds security checks. Most users shouldn't interact directly with the pair.`
mean anything found when users do interact directly with the pair is OOB of the contest ?


[10/15/2022 07:34] Franfran#5067
means that you can swap using pairs directly but it's not advised, and the router adds the necessary security checks to ensure it's safe to use


[10/15/2022 07:34] Franfran#5067
what's the reason of doing `creationUnlocked`, why not letting people create pairs ?


[10/15/2022 07:42] rustyrabbit
But would it make a finding invalid if it requires a user to interact directly with the pool.


[10/15/2022 07:43] Franfran#5067
I don't think so


[10/15/2022 07:43] rustyrabbit
I assume it's a safety feature to start out with approved pools first. Like training wheels.

[10/15/2022 07:50] Franfran#5067
Ah capital inefficiency, but I assume that people will deposit where they are incentivized to do so, so why not still ?


[10/15/2022 07:53] pecio33#5843
Yeah, capital efficiency + soft start + parameters for actual mainnet are carefully simulated


[10/15/2022 07:54] pecio33#5843
You can of course create your own markets if you want, just fork the network and spoof an address with `vm.prank` or anything that your framework provides


[10/15/2022 07:54] Franfran#5067
got it, but if rewards are where the pairs are not existing on your exchange, why would people deposit on the pairs they are constrained to ?


[10/15/2022 07:55] pecio33#5843
Just look how many junk there is on V1 😉


[10/15/2022 07:56] pecio33#5843
But yes, there would be not much financial incentive to deploy random markets


[10/15/2022 07:56] Franfran#5067
🤔


[10/15/2022 07:56] Franfran#5067
is that bad?


[10/15/2022 07:57] pecio33#5843
For a start of new protocol? I think yes, it would be bad, although I'm personally 100% for all being permissionless

[10/15/2022 08:01] pecio33#5843
Interacting with LBRouter directly is recommended for most users because it's simple and doesn't require much work. Interacting directly with pairs requires writing custom contract, but it would be a way that will be probably chosen by protocols building on top of V2 + certainly the way that potential exploiters would use

How can you run slither through the vscode extension? The command from the README works for me, but not the extension.


[10/16/2022 10:09] koolexc
Is there any more info (docs or something) about the flash loan?


[10/16/2022 10:40] koolexc
I would like to have some insights on the flow of it. 
Is it multiple assets loan (two from what I see in the contract code) ?
does the transaction revert if the amount is not paid back in the same transaction? or are you using other ways (e.g. a debt) to ensure this?


[10/16/2022 10:47] rustyrabbit
Am I getting this right regarding presets and binsteps: governance sets the parameters of certain binsteps and only those can be used to create LBPairs?


[10/16/2022 11:00] pecio33#5843
LBPairs can be created with any parameters (some things are enforced by code), but on this stage this is blocked by `!creationUnlocked`


[10/16/2022 11:06] koolexc
@pecio33 I would appreciate any insights on this ☝🏻


[10/16/2022 11:14] pecio33#5843
You can flashloan both assets that are in given pair. I think if flashloan is not repaid tx reverts, but would love @Louis confirmation on this

{Reactions}
👍🏻 thankyou 

[10/16/2022 11:16] louis_myself
Correct, you need to payback the loan and the fees in the same transaction

{Reactions}
👍🏻 

[10/16/2022 11:19] louis_myself
That is correct, markets need to be created using the presets the governance has chosen. The pair can’t be created by anyone unless the creation is unlocked

Thank you, I DMed you.

can anyone please help me make sense of this concept of "debt"?


[10/16/2022 18:18] ladboy233

[10/16/2022 18:18] ladboy233
how come there are debt?


[10/16/2022 18:18] ladboy233
in the process of fee generation?

1/ @Uniswap v3 introduces a new form of MEV attack — Just-in-Time Liquidity (JIT), that allows LPs to add and remove concentrated liquidity positions atomically in one block. Sophisticated actors are running JIT bots to sandwich trades, to the detriment of pre-existing LPs 👇🧵

Is the protocol concern about Just-in-time liquidity? It may damage LP profit but it minimize trading slippage. Also this JIT is only for most sophisticated trader to capture. so the impact is difficult to measure.

[10/18/2022 11:53] blueclarity
Hey, no we are not concerned with JIT

If it is profitable to fill liquidity at any point, we should allow it rather than restrict it. We seek free market sustainability not restrictive measures on liquidity provisioning. 

If you take a step back this is similar comparision to concentrated liquidity v passive liquidity. Sophisticated users will be able to manage their positions to take more fees with less capital v those who opt for a more passive approach with their concentrated liquidity provisioning. JIT is just a magnification of that and is part of an open and free market.

why is it so crucial to receive awax only from wavax in `LBRouter.sol`?

[10/19/2022 15:30] louis_myself
Because users would loose their avax if they sent it directly


[10/19/2022 15:34] road220
thx got u, i was looking for some possible LBRouter.balance dependent functionality in order to break them by sending native tokens forcefully 🙂

anybody knows/has the code to convert `getPriceFromId` in human-readable form in the tests?

`price128x128 * 1e18 >> 128` will convert it to base10 with 18 decimals

@Louis  Is there a benefit for the liquidity provider if he/she leaves the fees not collected (from swapping/flash loans) for sometime?


[10/20/2022 13:34] louis_myself
No, it will just wait until it’s collected

Looks like protocol behaves as it should, you can collect fees after tokens are burnt.

No, to discuss any findings (including stuff like blog post) you should wait for the report to be released, because that's when the sponsor is fine with getting the findings public

Sorry, I still don't quite understand why my finding was judged H-01, but the reward was only 0.33 USDC.

It was reported by 18 people. Duplicates are penalized.


[12/07/2022 00:44] ladboy233
Yeap. either find unique finding or not get paid 🙂


[12/07/2022 00:51] shawn_xu
Is there a change in the awarding strategy? I remember the last time I submitted a high risk vulnerability, 10 people submitted the same report, but 10 people split the reward.👀


[12/07/2022 00:52] trust90
Run the math on 0.6^17


[12/07/2022 00:54] jeiwan
Yep, they adjusted the rewarding formula for this and 3 other contests to penalize duplicates even more.

[12/07/2022 01:05] shawn_xu
Perhaps the reason so many people submit the same high-risk vulnerability is because it's so easy to find. 😂 I only got involved in September, this is the second high-risk bug I've submitted, and it would be too bad if there was no reward because too many people submitted it. Thank you for your answer. Bonus or no bonus, I don't have to check in every now and then 😂


[12/07/2022 05:08] parashar
They are penalising duplicates but how does one know if his finding is duplicate while submitting, maybe you can have weighted distribution based on who submitted it earlier, but penalising doesn’t make sense. 0.33 for a High risk vulnerability is a joke


[12/07/2022 05:11] pfapostol
Does it make any sense who submit it first? If 18 people found a vulnerability, then it was too easy to find it, and it would be weird to encourage someone for sending reports faster the rest.


[12/07/2022 05:29] parashar
Easy should not really be a factor, if it is a high risk factor. And no even time based would be rewarding won’t exactly be fair but still better than penalising for duplicates

{Reactions}
👍🏻 

[12/07/2022 05:34] pfapostol
In order to find and fix basic vulnerabilities depending on their criticality, a company can run a regular BB or a regular audit. As far as I understand, the goal of C4 is to significantly increase audit coverage, in this sense, uniqueness is more important than criticality.


[12/07/2022 09:36] rustyrabbit
Problem is to many wardens competing for the same money.  A problem that will solve itself with low payouts.
Although in this contest there were enough high value findings, so interested to review those findings.

Definitely looking forward to being able to see why my findings were completely invalidated apparently. : /

We discovered after further review that we missed 1 valid report, so we have updated the leaderboard accordingly. All payouts will match what was posted above, but @rbserver will receive an additional payout of $306.35 USDC.
